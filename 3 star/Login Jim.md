in order to login with Jim we need 2 things, his email and password

get Jim's email from either: 
* reviews on products
* (or what I did) from the `/administration` page we found earlier![image](https://github.com/0xbazooka/juice-shop/assets/99322823/f9589462-54db-498e-897f-066bcea59154)



we're missing the pass but technically we don't need it we're hackers :D  so instead we'll break through with SQLI
the payload `jim@juice-sh.op' --` so basically commenting out the password field aslan
